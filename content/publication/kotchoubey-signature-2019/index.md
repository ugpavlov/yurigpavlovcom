abstract: Many passive oddball experiments show a sharp negative deflection N3 after
  P3b, peaking between 400 and 500 ms, but this wave has never been analyzed properly.
  We conducted five passive oddball experiments, in which the number of deviants (i.e.,
  one or two), their alleged meaning and their distinctiveness varied. Mastoid- or
  common-referenced waveforms showed a fronto-central N3 in all experiments. The data
  were CSD (Current Source Density) transformed and underwent a Principal Component
  Analysis (PCA). The PCA revealed N3 containing two subcomponents with very stable
  peak latencies of about 415 and 455 ms, respectively. Both topography of the subcomponents
  and their variation with experimental conditions were very similar, indicating a
  midfrontal sink and a posterior temporal source. Positive components P3a and P3b
  were also analyzed, replicating the previously known effects. We discuss the similarities
  and differences between the passive N3 and other components including the MMN, N1,
  late positive Slow Wave, and reorienting negativity. We also make general hypotheses
  about a possible functional meaning of N3; on this basis, specific hypotheses are
  formulated and further experiments are suggested to test these hypotheses.
