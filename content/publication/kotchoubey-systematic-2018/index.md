abstract: A systematic search revealed 68 empirical studies of neurophysiological
  (EEG, ERP, fMRI, PET) variables as potential outcome predictors in patients with
  Disorders of Consciousness (diagnoses Unresponsive Wakefulness Syndrome [UWS] and
  Minimally Conscious State [MCS]). Data of 47 publications could be presented in
  a quantitative manner and systematically reviewed. Insufficient power and the lack
  of an appropriate description of patient selection each characterized about a half
  of all publications. In more than 80% studies, neurologists who evaluated the patientsâ€™
  outcome were familiar with the results of neurophysiological tests conducted before,
  and may, therefore, have been influenced by this knowledge. In most subsamples of
  data sets effect size significantly correlated with its standard error, indicating
  publication bias toward positive results. Neurophysiological data predicted the
  transition from UWS to MCS substantially better than they predicted the recovery
  of consciousness (i.e., the transition from UWS or MCS to exit-MCS). A meta-analysis
  was carried out for predictor groups including at least three independent studies
  with N textgreater 10 per predictor per improvement criterion (i.e., transition
  to MCS versus recovery). Oscillatory EEG responses were the only predictor group
  whose effect attained significance for both improvement criteria. Other perspective
  variables, whose true prognostic value should be explored in future studies, are
  sleep spindles in the EEG and the somatosensory cortical response N20. Contrary
  to what could be expected on the basis of neuroscience theory, the poorest prognostic
  effects were shown for fMRI responses to stimulation and for the ERP component P300.
  The meta-analytic results should be regarded as preliminary given the presence of
  numerous biases in the data.
