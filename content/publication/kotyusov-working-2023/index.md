abstract: 'Working memory and attention are interrelated constructs that are sometimes
  even considered indistinguishable. Since attention is not a uniform construct, it
  is possible that different types of attention affect working memory capacity differently.
  To clarify this issue, we investigated the relationship between working memory capacity
  and various components of attention. The sample consisted of 136 healthy adult participants
  aged 18 to 37 years (M = 20.58, SD = 2.74). Participants performed tasks typically
  used to assess working memory (operation span, change detection, simple digit span,
  and adaptive digit span tasks), selective attention (visual search task), and attention
  control (Stroop and antisaccade tasks). We tested several models with working memory
  and attention, either as a unitary factor or being divided into selective attention
  and attention control factors. A confirmatory factor analysis showed that the model
  with three latent variables—working memory capacity, attention control, and selective
  attention—fit the data best. Results showed that working memory and attention are
  distinct but correlated constructs: working memory capacity was only related to
  attention control, whereas attention control was related to both constructs. We
  propose that differences in working memory capacity are determined only by the ability
  to maintain attention on the task, while differences in the ability to filter out
  non-salient distractors are not related to working memory capacity.'
