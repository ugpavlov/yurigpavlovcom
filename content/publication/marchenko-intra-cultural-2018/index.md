abstract: This study was aimed to examine intra-cultural continuity and regional specificity
  of generation frequency norms for semantic categories in the Russian language. Participants
  from three different regions of Russia carried out a standard procedure for generating
  exemplars of 45 semantic categories. Overall generation frequency compared between
  three regions for each concept in order to study the regional specificity of concepts.
  Hellinger Affinity scores were used as a measure of between-regional accordance
  of generation frequency norms. Generation frequency for most concepts did not differ
  significantly between all three regions and Hellinger Affinity coefficients were
  strong providing evidence for the intra-cultural homogeneity of these norms in Russia.
  However, the number of concepts with significantly different generation frequency
  values was lower and the Hellinger Affinity was significantly stronger when a geographical
  distance between cities was smaller. Significant differences of generation frequencies
  between regions, elicited in a study for a small number of concepts, can be explained
  by geographical, environmental and experiential factors.
