abstract: Sleep-wakefulness cycles are an essential diagnostic criterion for disorders
  of consciousness (DOC), differentiating prolonged DOC from coma. Specific sleep
  features, like the presence of sleep spindles, are an important marker for the prognosis
  of recovery from DOC. Based on increasing evidence for a link between sleep and
  neuronal plasticity, understanding sleep in DOC might facilitate the development
  of novel methods for rehabilitation. Yet, well-controlled studies of sleep in DOC
  are lacking. Here, we aimed to quantify, on a reliable evaluation basis, the distribution
  of behavioral and neurophysiological sleep patterns in DOC over a 24-h period while
  controlling for environmental factors (by recruiting a group of conscious tetraplegic
  patients who resided in the same hospital).
