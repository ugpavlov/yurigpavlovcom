abstract: "Good Scientific Practice (GSP) refers to both explicit and implicit rules,
  recommendations, and guidelines that help scientists to produce work that is of
  the highest quality at any given time, and to efficiently share that work with the
  community for further scrutiny or utilization. For experimental research using magneto-
  and electroencephalography (MEEG), GSP includes specific standards and guidelines
  for technical competence, which are periodically updated and adapted to new findings.
  However, GSP also needs to be periodically revisited in a broader light. At the
  LiveMEEG 2020 conference, a reflection on GSP was fostered that included explicitly
  documented guidelines and technical advances, but also emphasized intangible GSP:
  a general awareness of personal, organizational, and societal realities and how
  they can influence MEEG research. This article provides an extensive report on most
  of the LiveMEEG contributions and new literature, with the additional aim to synthesize
  ongoing cultural changes in GSP. It first covers GSP with respect to cognitive biases
  and logical fallacies, pre-registration as a tool to avoid those and other early
  pitfalls, and a number of resources to enable collaborative and reproducible research
  as a general approach to minimize misconceptions. Second, it covers GSP with respect
  to data acquisition, analysis, reporting, and sharing, including new tools and frameworks
  to support collaborative work. Finally, GSP is considered in light of ethical implications
  of MEEG research and the resulting responsibility that scientists have to engage
  with societal challenges. Considering among other things the benefits of peer review
  and open access at all stages, the need to coordinate larger international projects,
  the complexity of MEEG subject matter, and today's prioritization of fairness, privacy,
  and the environment, we find that current GSP tends to favor collective and cooperative
  work, for both scientific and for societal reasons."
