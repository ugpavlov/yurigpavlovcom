abstract: 'There is growing awareness across the neuroscience community that the replicability
  of findings on the relationship between brain activity and cognitive phenomena can
  be improved by conducting studies with high statistical power that adhere to well-defined
  and standardized analysis pipelines. Inspired by efforts from the psychological
  sciences, and with the desire to examine some of the foundational findings using
  electroencephalography (EEG), we have launched #EEGManyLabs, a large-scale international
  collaborative replication effort. Since its discovery in the early 20th century,
  EEG has had a profound influence on our understanding of human cognition, but there
  is limited evidence on the replicability of some of the most highly cited discoveries.
  After a systematic search and selection process, we have identified 27 of the most
  influential and continually cited studies in the field. We plan to directly test
  the replicability of key findings from 20 of these studies in teams of at least
  three independent laboratories. The design and protocol of each replication effort
  will be submitted as a Registered Report and peer-reviewed prior to data collection.
  Prediction markets, open to all EEG researchers, will be used as a forecasting tool
  to examine which findings the community expects to replicate. This project will
  update our confidence in some of the most influential EEG findings and generate
  a large open access database that can be used to inform future research practices.
  Finally, through this international effort, we hope to create a cultural shift towards
  inclusive, high-powered multi-laboratory collaborations.'
