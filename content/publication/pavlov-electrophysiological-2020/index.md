abstract: Working memory (WM) consists of short-term storage and executive components.
  We studied cortical oscillatory correlates of these two components in a large sample
  of 156 participants to assess separately the contribution of them to individual
  differences in WM. The participants were presented with WM tasks of above-average
  complexity. Some of the tasks required only storage in WM, others required storage
  and mental manipulations. Our data indicate a close relationship between frontal
  midline theta, central beta activity and the executive components of WM. The oscillatory
  counterparts of the executive components were associated with individual differences
  in verbal WM performance. In contrast, alpha activity was not related to the individual
  differences. The results demonstrate that executive components of WM, rather than
  short-term storage capacity, play the decisive role in individual WM capacity limits.
