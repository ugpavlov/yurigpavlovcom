abstract: Fear memories can be altered after acquisition by processes, such as fear
  memory consolidation or fear extinction, even without further exposure to the fear-eliciting
  stimuli, but factors contributing to these processes are not well understood. Sleep
  is known to consolidate, strengthen, and change newly acquired declarative and procedural
  memories. However, evidence on the role of time and sleep in the consolidation of
  fear memories is inconclusive. We used highly sensitive electrophysiological measures
  to examine the development of fear-conditioned responses over time and sleep in
  humans. We assessed event-related brain potentials (ERP) in 18 healthy, young individuals
  during fear conditioning before and after a 2-hour afternoon nap or a corresponding
  wake interval in a counterbalanced within-subject design. The procedure involved
  pairing a neutral tone (CS+) with a highly unpleasant sound. As a control, another
  neutral tone (CSâˆ’) was paired with a neutral sound. Fear responses were examined
  before the interval during a habituation phase and an acquisition phase as well
  as after the interval during an extinction phase and a reacquisition phase. Differential
  fear conditioning during acquisition was evidenced by a more negative slow ERP component
  (stimulus-preceding negativity) developing before the unconditioned stimulus (loud
  noise). This differential fear response was even stronger after the interval during
  reacquisition compared with initial acquisition, but this effect was similarly pronounced
  after sleep and wakefulness. These findings suggest that fear memories are consolidated
  over time, with this effect being independent of intervening sleep.
