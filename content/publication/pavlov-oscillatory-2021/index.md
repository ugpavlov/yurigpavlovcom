abstract: 'Brain oscillations likely play a significant role in the storage of information
  in working memory (WM). Despite the wide popularity of the topic, current attempts
  to summarize the research in the field are narrative reviews. We address this gap
  by providing a descriptive systematic review, in which we investigated oscillatory
  correlates of maintenance of verbal and visual information in WM. The systematic
  approach enabled us to challenge some common views popularized by previous research.
  The identified literature (100 EEG/MEG studies) highlighted the importance of theta
  oscillations in verbal WM: frontal midline theta enhanced with load in most verbal
  studies, while more equivocal results have been obtained in visual studies. Increasing
  WM load affected alpha activity in most studies, but the direction of the effect
  was inconsistent: the ratio of studies that found alpha increase versus decrease
  with increasing load was 80/20% in the verbal WM domain and close to 60/40% in the
  visual domain. Alpha asymmetry (left textless right) was a common finding in both
  verbal and visual WM studies. Beta and gamma activity studies yielded the least
  convincing data: a diversity in the spatial and frequency distribution of beta activity
  prevented us from making a coherent conclusion; gamma rhythm was virtually neglected
  in verbal WM studies with no systematic support for sustained gamma changes during
  the delay in EEG studies in general.'
