abstract: A preregistered meta-analysis, including 244 effect sizes from 85 field
  audits and 361,645 individual job applications, tested for gender bias in hiring
  practices in female-stereotypical and gender-balanced as well as male-stereotypical
  jobs from 1976 to 2020. A “red team” of independent experts was recruited to increase
  the rigor and robustness of our meta-analytic approach. A forecasting survey further
  examined whether laypeople (n = 499 nationally representative adults) and scientists
  (n = 312) could predict the results. Forecasters correctly anticipated reductions
  in discrimination against female candidates over time. However, both scientists
  and laypeople overestimated the continuation of bias against female candidates.
  Instead, selection bias in favor of male over female candidates was eliminated and,
  if anything, slightly reversed in sign starting in 2009 for mixed-gender and male-stereotypical
  jobs in our sample. Forecasters further failed to anticipate that discrimination
  against male candidates for stereotypically female jobs would remain stable across
  the decades.
