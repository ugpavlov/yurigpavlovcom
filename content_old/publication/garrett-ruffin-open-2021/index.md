abstract: 'The present review is the result of a one-day workshop on open science,
  held at the Annual Meeting of the Society for Psychophysiological Research in Washington,
  DC, September 2019. The contributors represent psychophysiological researchers at
  different career stages and from a wide spectrum of institutions. The state of open
  science in psychophysiology is discussed from different perspectives, highlighting
  key challenges, potential benefits, and emerging solutions that are intended to
  facilitate open science practices. Three domains are emphasized: data sharing, preregistration,
  and multi-site studies. In the context of these broader domains, we present potential
  implementations of specific open science procedures such as data format harmonization,
  power analysis, data, presentation code and analysis pipeline sharing, suitable
  for psychophysiological research. Practical steps are discussed that may be taken
  to facilitate the adoption of open science practices in psychophysiology. These
  steps include (1) promoting broad and accessible training in the skills needed to
  implement open science practices, such as collaborative research and computational
  reproducibility initiatives, (2) establishing mechanisms that provide practical
  assistance in sharing of processing pipelines, presentation code, and data in an
  efficient way, and (3) improving the incentive structure for open science approaches.
  Throughout the manuscript, we provide references and links to available resources
  for those interested in adopting open science practices in their research.'
