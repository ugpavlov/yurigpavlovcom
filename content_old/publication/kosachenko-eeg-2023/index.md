abstract: Understanding the physiological correlates of cognitive overload has implications
  for gauging the limits of human cognition, developing novel methods to define cognitive
  overload, and mitigating the negative outcomes associated with overload. Most previous
  psychophysiological studies manipulated verbal working memory load in a narrow range
  (an average load of 5 items). It is unclear, however, how the nervous system responds
  to a working memory load exceeding typical capacity limits. The objective of the
  current study was to characterize the central and autonomic nervous system changes
  associated with memory overload, by means of combined recording of electroencephalogram
  (EEG) and pupillometry. Eighty-six participants were presented with a digit span
  task involving the serial auditory presentation of items. Each trial consisted of
  sequences of either 5, 9, or 13 digits, each separated by 2 s. Both theta activity
  and pupil size, after the initial rise, expressed a pattern of a short plateau and
  a decrease with reaching the state of memory overload, indicating that pupil size
  and theta possibly have similar neural mechanisms. Based on the described above
  triphasic pattern of pupil size temporal dynamics, we concluded that cognitive overload
  causes physiological systems to reset, and release effort. Although memory capacity
  limits were exceeded and effort was released (as indicated by pupil dilation), alpha
  continued to decrease with increasing memory load. These results suggest that associating
  alpha with the focus of attention and distractor suppression is not warranted.
