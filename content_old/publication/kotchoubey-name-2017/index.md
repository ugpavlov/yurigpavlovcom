abstract: Four experiments are reported in which two harmonic tones (CS+ and CS−)
  were paired with a participant’s own name (SON) and different names (DN), respectively.
  A third tone was not paired with any other stimulus and served as a standard (frequent
  stimulus) in a three-stimuli oddball paradigm. The larger posterior positivity (P3)
  to SON than DN, found in previous studies, was replicated in all experiments. Conditioning
  of the P3 response was albeit observed in two similar experiments (1 and 3), but
  the obtained effects were weak and not identical in the two experiments. Only Experiment
  4, where the number of CS/UCS pairings and the Stimulus-Onset Asynchrony between
  CS and UCS were increased, showed clear CS+/CS− differences both in time and time–frequency
  domains. Surprisingly, differential responses to CS+ and CS− were also obtained
  in Experiment 2, although SON and DN in that experiment were masked and never consciously
  recognized as meaningful words (recognition rate 0/63 participants). The results
  are discussed in the context of other ERP conditioning experiments and, particularly,
  the studies of non-conscious effect on ERP. Several further experiments are suggested
  to replicate and extend the present findings and to remove the remaining methodological
  limitations.
