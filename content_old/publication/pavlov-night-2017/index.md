abstract: Polysomnographic recording of night sleep was carried out in 15 patients
  with the diagnosis vegetative state (syn. unresponsive wakefulness syndrome). Sleep
  scoring was performed by three raters, and conﬁrmed by means of a spectral power
  analysis of the electroencephalogram, electrooculogram and electromyogram. All patients
  but one exhibited at least some signs of sleep. In particular, sleep stage N1 was
  found in 13 patients, N2 in 14 patients, N3 in nine patients, and rapid eye movement
  sleep in 10 patients. Three patients exhibited all phenomena characteristic for
  normal sleep, including spindles and rapid eye movements. However, in all but one
  patient, sleep patterns were severely disturbed as compared with normative data.
  All patients had frequent and long periods of wakefulness during the night. In some
  apparent rapid eye movement sleep episodes, no eye movements were recorded. Sleep
  spindles were detected in ﬁve patients only, and their density was very low. We
  conclude that the majority of vegetative state patients retain some important circadian
  changes. Further studies are necessary to disentangle multiple factors potentially
  affecting sleep pattern of vegetative state patients.
