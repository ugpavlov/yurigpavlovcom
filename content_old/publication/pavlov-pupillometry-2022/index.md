abstract: This dataset consists of raw 64-channel EEG, cardiovascular (electrocardiography
  and photoplethysmography), and pupillometry data from 86 human participants recorded
  during 4 minutes of eyes-closed resting and during performance of a classic working
  memory task – digit span task with serial recall. The participants either memorized
  or just listened to sequences of 5, 9, or 13 digits presented auditorily every 2 seconds.
  The dataset can be used for (1) developing algorithms for cognitive load discrimination
  and detection of cognitive overload; (2) studying neural (event-related potentials
  and brain oscillations) and peripheral (electrocardiography, photoplethysmography,
  and pupillometry) physiological signals during encoding and maintenance of each
  sequentially presented memory item; (3) correlating cognitive load and individual
  differences in working memory to neural and peripheral physiology, and studying
  the relationship between the physiological signals; (4) integration of the physiological
  findings with the vast knowledge coming from behavioral studies of verbal working
  memory in simple span paradigms. The data are shared in Brain Imaging Data Structure
  (BIDS) format and freely available on OpenNeuro (https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds003838).
