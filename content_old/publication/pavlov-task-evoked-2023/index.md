abstract: Cognitive load is a crucial factor in mentally demanding activities and
  holds significance across various research fields. This study aimed to investigate
  the effectiveness of pulse wave amplitude (PWA) as a measure for tracking cognitive
  load and associated mental effort in comparison to heart rate (HR) during a digit
  span task. The data from 78 participants were included in the analyses. Participants
  performed a memory task in which they were asked to memorize sequences of 5, 9,
  or 13 digits, and a control task where they passively listened to the sequences.
  PWA and HR were quantified from photoplethysmography (PPG) and electrocardiography
  (ECG), respectively. Pupil dilation was also assessed as a measure of cognitive
  load. We found that PWA showed a strong suppression with increasing memory load,
  indicating sensitivity to cognitive load. In contrast, HR did not show significant
  changes with task difficulty. Moreover, when memory load exceeded the capacity of
  working memory, a reversal of the PWA pattern was observed, indicating cognitive
  overload. In this respect, changes in PWA in response to cognitive load correlated
  with the dynamics of pupil dilation, suggesting a potential shared underlying mechanism.
  Additionally, both HR and PWA demonstrated a relationship with behavioral performance,
  with higher task-evoked HR and lower PWA associated with better memory performance.
  Our findings suggest that PWA is a more sensitive measure than HR for tracking cognitive
  load and overload. PWA, measured through PPG, holds significant potential for practical
  applications in assessing cognitive load due to its ease of use and sensitivity
  to cognitive overload. The findings contribute to the understanding of psychophysiological
  indicators of cognitive load and offer insights into the use of PWA as a non-invasive
  measure in various contexts.
