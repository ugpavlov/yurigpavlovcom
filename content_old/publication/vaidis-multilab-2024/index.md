abstract: 'According to cognitive-dissonance theory, performing counterattitudinal
  behavior produces a state of dissonance that people are motivated to resolve, usually
  by changing their attitude to be in line with their behavior. One of the most popular
  experimental paradigms used to produce such attitude change is the induced-compliance
  paradigm. Despite its popularity, the replication crisis in social psychology and
  other fields, as well as methodological limitations associated with the paradigm,
  raise concerns about the robustness of classic studies in this literature. We therefore
  conducted a multilab constructive replication of the induced-compliance paradigm
  based on Croyle and Cooper (Experiment 1). In a total of 39 labs from 19 countries
  and 14 languages, participants (N = 4,898) were assigned to one of three conditions:
  writing a counterattitudinal essay under high choice, writing a counterattitudinal
  essay under low choice, or writing a neutral essay under high choice. The primary
  analyses failed to support the core hypothesis: No significant difference in attitude
  was observed after writing a counterattitudinal essay under high choice compared
  with low choice. However, we did observe a significant difference in attitude after
  writing a counterattitudinal essay compared with writing a neutral essay. Secondary
  analyses revealed the pattern of results to be robust to data exclusions, lab variability,
  and attitude assessment. Additional exploratory analyses were conducted to test
  predictions from cognitive-dissonance theory. Overall, the results call into question
  whether the induced-compliance paradigm provides robust evidence for cognitive dissonance.'
