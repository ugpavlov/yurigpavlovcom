abstract: Processes typically encompassed by working memory (WM) include encoding,
  retention, and retrieval of information. Previous research has demonstrated that
  motivation can influence WM performance, although the specific WM processes affected
  by motivation are not yet fully understood. In this study, we investigated the effects
  of motivation on different WM processes, examining how task difficulty modulates
  these effects. We hypothesized that motivation level and personality traits of the
  participants (N = 48, 32 females; mean age = 21) would modulate the parietal alpha
  and frontal theta electroencephalography (EEG) correlates of WM encoding, retention,
  and retrieval phases of the Sternberg task. This effect was expected to be more
  pronounced under conditions of very high task difficulty. We found that increasing
  difficulty led to reduced accuracy and increased response time, but no significant
  relationship was found between motivation and accuracy. However, EEG data revealed
  that motivation influenced WM processes, as indicated by changes in alpha and theta
  oscillations. Specifically, higher levels of the Resilience trait—associated with
  mental toughness, hardiness, self-efficacy, achievement motivation, and low anxiety—were
  related to increased alpha desynchronization during encoding and retrieval. Increased
  scores of Subjective Motivation to perform well in the task were related to enhanced
  frontal midline theta during retention. Additionally, these effects were significantly
  stronger under conditions of high difficulty. These findings provide insights into
  the specific WM processes that are influenced by motivation, and underscore the
  importance of considering both task difficulty and intrinsic motivation in WM research.
